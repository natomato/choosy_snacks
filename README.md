# Full Stack Redux Tutorial Redo

## WIP --- only about 75% complete

This is an implementation of the terrific tutorial by @teropa
with a few updates. The tutorial is fantastic, thorough, and follows [common best practices](https://medium.com/javascript-and-opinions/state-of-the-art-javascript-in-2016-ab67fc68eb0b#.u80vh537a), but as React is quickly changing in just 6 months some of it is no longer recommended by react.

This tutorial makes a few small changes as react recommends using class extends to create components instead of React.createClass and shallowRender for testing.

I also added the Enzyme testing library syntax to ease the test writing and take advantage of the newer shallowRender capabilities.
